Type casting is a process of converting one data type into another data type.

There are 2 types of type casting
    ->implicit type casting(Widening)
    ->explicit type casting(Narrowing)

implicit type casting:
    it is a process of converting small datatype to big datatype
    it will be done automatically by the compiler.
    here There is no chance for data loss.

Explicit type casting:
    it is a process of converting big datatype to small datatype
    it will be done Done manually by the programmer.
    here There is Possible chance for data loss.

Ex:
#include <stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int a=5,b=2;
    float f = a/b;
    printf("%f\n",f);//implicit
    printf("%f",(float)a/b);//explicit
    return 0;
}
