a file is a stograge space where data is stored permanently

in c language we can use files to store ,read and manipulate the data 

using inbuilt functions availabe in <stdio.h> library.

Basic file operations:

operation               function                working

open a file             fopen()                 opens an existing file or creates a new file

read data               fscanf()/fgets()        reads data from a file

write data              fprintf()/fputs()       write data to a file

close file              fclose                  closes an opened file


syntax:
FILE *file_pointer;

fopen() syntax:
    file_pointer = fopen("file_name.txt","mode");

fclose() syntax:
    fclose(file_pointer);


common modes:

"r"     -   read mode
"w"     -   write mode (overwrites data)
"a"     -   append mode (keeps old data)
"r+"    -   Read + Write mode
"w+"	-   Write + Read	(overwrites data)
"a+"	-   Append + Read	(keeps old data)
