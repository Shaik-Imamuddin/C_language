Compiler	                        Interpreter
1.Compiler Takes entire	            1.Interpreter Takes single 
  program as input.                   instructions as input.

2.Creates a separate	            2.Does not create a separate file,
  executable file(e.g.,.exe).         executes directly.

3.Faster execution                  3.Slower execution 
(since whole program is already       (translation happens line-by-line 
translated before running).	            at runtime).

4.Shows all errors at           	4.Stops immediately when an error
once after compilation.               is found (one at a time).

5.Needs more memory	                5.Uses less memory
(stores executable file).             (no separate executable file).

6.Example:C, C++, Java.	            6.Ex:Python, JavaScript, Ruby, PHP.
