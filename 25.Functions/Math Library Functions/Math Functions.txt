There is a library called <math.h> which contains all the in-built functions used to perform mathematical operations. 

The following functions are mainly used mathematical functions:

pow(a,b) -> it will returns a^b
sqrt(x) -> it is used to return square root of x.
cbrt(x) -> it is used to return cube root of x.

ceil(x) -> it will round up the x value
floor(x) -> it will round down the x value
round(x) -> it will returns nearest value to x

fabs(x) -> it returns absolute value of x
fmod(a,b) -> it returns the remainder of a and b
fmax(a,b) -> it returns the maximum number from a and b
fmin(a,b) -> it returns the minimum number from a and b

log(x) -> it returns the natural log value with base e
log10(x) -> it returns the log value with base 10

for all the above functions we have to pass the parameters in double format.
