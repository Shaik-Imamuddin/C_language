Operator is a symbol which is used to perform operations on operands.

Operator is just nothing but a symbol like + , - , * , = , & , || ... etc.

operands will represented as follows
        variables   -   a+b
        values      -   10-5
        constants   -   a+3.14
        expressions -   a=a*b
    
There are 3 categories of operators :
        ->unary operators
        ->Binary operators
        ->Ternary operators

unary operators:
    The operators which holds a single operand comes under unary operators

        Ex: ++a , a++ , --a , a-- , ~a , !(a>b) 

Binary operators:
    The operators which holds a exactly two operands comes under Binary operators
    All the remaining operators comes under Binary except unary and Ternary.

    Ex: a+b , a*b , a/b , a&b , a^b , a=b ,and so on ........

Ternary operators:
    The operators which holds more than 2 operands comes under Ternary operators
    The only operator comes under Ternary is conditional operator also known as Ternary operator.

    EX: (a>b)?a:b;

There are 8 types of operators in c language:

        1.Arithmetic operators
        2.Relational operators
        3.Logical operators
        4.Assignment operators
        5.Bitwise operators
        6.Increment and decrement operator
        7.conditional operator
        8.Special operators
