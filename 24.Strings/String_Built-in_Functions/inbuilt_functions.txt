built-in functions are nothing built already developed methods,just we have to use them if it is needed.

whenever we are using the built-in functions 
    we have to import the string library which is having all built-in functions #include<string.h>.

The Following are string inbuilt methods:

strlen()-finds the length of the string.
strcat()-it appends one string at the end of another.
strncat()-it appends first n charecters of a string at the end of another.
strcpy()-used to copy a string to another.
strncpy()-used to copy first n charecters of a string to another.
strcmp()- it is used to compare 2 strings.
strncmp() - it is used to compare first n charecters 2 strings.
strchr() - find out first occurence of a given charecter in a string.
strrchr() - find out last occurence of a given charecter in a string.
strrev() - used to reverse the given string.

The following are two more important methods available in ctype.h library

tolower() - used to convert the charecters into lowercase.
toupper() - used to convert the charecters into uppercase.
