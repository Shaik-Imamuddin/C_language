Modifiers are used to increase or decrease the size of the primitive Datatypes

There are 2 types of Modifiers  

        ->size Modifiers
        ->sign Modifiers

->size Modifiers: 
        short
        long

->sign Modifiers
        signed
        unsigned

size Modifiers: 

short will takes 2 bytes of memory we can use to store small integer values within the range.
so , instead of using int for small values we can use short

long will takes 4 bytes of memory in C language we can use to store large integer values which exceeds the integer range.
so , instead of using int for storing large integer values we can use long 

Syntax for short: 

        short variable_name;

        short datatype variable_name

Syntax for long:

        long variable_name;

        long datatype variable_name

sign Modifiers:

signed and unsigned will be used only along with char and int

By default all the numbers are signed numbers. means contains of both positive and negative numbers

if we need only positive numbers then we need to use unsigned.

Syntax for signed:
        signed datatype variable_name; 
        
        //signed is optional because all primitive typres are signed by default

Syntax for signed:
        unsigned datatype variable_name;

        EX: Age , Weight , Height .... contains only positive numbers.
