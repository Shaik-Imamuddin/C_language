What is programming language?
    -> is nothing but a communication language between human and machine.
Why we need programming language?
    -> to avoid the mistakes made by humans during work, we are going to give instruction to a machine.

Types of programming language
    Low level languages
    Intermediate level languages
    High level languages    


Low level language
    -> Binary language (0 & 1)
        Eg: if i want to add 4 & 5
        4 -> 0100
        5 -> 0101
        + -> 1111 -> Op. Codes (Operational Code) 16 bit compiler architecture
        
        32 bit:
        4 -> 00100
        5 -> 00101
        + -> 11111
        
        -> Humans can't predict the compiler architecture, so whenever there is a change in compiler,
        we needs to change the entire program.
        
Intermediae language
    -> Assembly level langauge (Direct Machine Codes)(Microprocessor, Microcontroller)
    -> Keywords
    Eg: if i want to add 4 & 5
    ADD(4,5) -> 9 (without carry digit)
    ADC(4,5) -> 9 (with carry digit)
    ADDS
    SUB(5,4) -> 
    
    -> it will be easy when comparing with bianry language, but it will also have a disadvantage
    -> combiantion of keywords, so understanding the usage is difficult for the humans
            
High level language
    Eg: if i want to add 4 & 5
        4 + 5
        + -> symbol used for addition, will be only one and cannot be changed based on compiler.
