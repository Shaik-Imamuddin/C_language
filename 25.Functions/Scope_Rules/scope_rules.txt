Scope refers to the part of a program where a variable is accessible. There are mainly 2 types of scopes

    ->local scope
    ->global scope

Local Scope:

A variable has local scope if it is declared inside a function or a block.
It can be accessed only within that function or block.
Local variables are created when the function is called and destroyed when the function ends.

Global Scope:

A variable has global scope if it is declared outside all functions, usually at the top of the program.
It can be accessed by any function in the program.
Global variables exist throughout the program execution.
