Preprocessor directives are instructions that are processed before the actual compilation of a C program begins.

They all start with a # (hash symbol) and are handled by the C preprocessor, not by the compiler.


#include	                        Includes contents of another file (like header files)	            #include <stdio.h>

#include <stdio.h>   // Standard header file
#include "myfile.h"  // User-defined header file

#define	                            Defines a constant or macro	                                        #define PI 3.14
#if, #else, #elif, #endif           Conditional compilation                                             #if AGE > 18



#define

The #define directive is used to define constants or macros in a C program.
It tells the preprocessor to replace a name with a value or expression before compilation.

Syntax:
#define name value



Conditional compilation:

Conditional compilation means compiling certain parts of a program only if specific conditions are true.

It’s done using preprocessor directives like:

#if
#else
#elif
#endif

These are handled by the C preprocessor before actual compilation.

Syntax:
#if condition
    // Code if condition is true
#elif another_condition
    // Code if the first condition is false but this one is true
#else
    // Code if none of the above are true
#endif
