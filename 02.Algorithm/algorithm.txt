Algorithm is a step by step process or sequence of steps used to slove a problem or perfrom a task.
and it is independent of programming languages.

Characteristics of a Good Algorithm:

    clear and Unambiguous - it needs to be simple and confusion less
    Finiteness            - it must end after some finite no.of steps
    input                 - it have to accept zero or more inputs
    output                - it needs to return one or more outputs
    Effectiveness         - it needs to be simple and executbale

Advantages of Algorithms: 
    1.  Easy to understand. 
    2. An algorithm uses a definite procedure. 
    3. Independent of any programming language
    4. Every step has its own logical sequence so it is easy to debug. 

Disdvantages of Algorithms: 
    1. Alogorithm is Time consuming. 
    2. Difficult to show Branching and Looping in Algorithms. 
    3. Big tasks are difficult to put in Algorithms.


we can write the Algorithm in 3 ways

Representation of Maximum of two numbers Algorithm

Plain English:
Step 1:start
Step 2:read two numbers
Step 3:compare two values(ex a and b)
Step 4:if a is greater than b display "a is greater" otherwise "b is greater"
Step 5:stop

Pseudocode:
START
READ A, B
IF A > B THEN
MAX ← A
ELSE
MAX ← B
ENDIF
DISPLAY MAX
END
