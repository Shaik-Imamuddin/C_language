A binary file is a file that stores data in the same format as it is stored in computer memory — as 0s and 1s (binary form).

binary files are not human-readable.

Binary files are more compact, faster to read/write data.

fwrite() Syntax:

fwrite(address_of_data, size_of_each_element, number_of_elements, file_pointer);

fread() Syntax:

fread(address_of_data, size_of_each_element, number_of_elements, file_pointer);
